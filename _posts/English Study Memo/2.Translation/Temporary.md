통상적으로 ‘인도주의’란 국경, 인종, 체제를 뛰어넘어 평화와 행복이라는 인간의 기본권을 추구하는 것을 말한다. 이는 우리의 전통 사상인 ‘홍익인간(널리 인간을 이롭게 한다)’과 ‘경천애인(하늘을 공경하고 인간을 사랑한다)’과도 맥을 같이 한다고 볼 수 있다. 우리 정부가 지향하는 ‘인도주의 외교’는 이와 같이 인간의 존엄성에 기초하여 인류 공영과 복지를 실현시키기 위한 인본주의에 기반하고 있다

The trade relationship between the US and China has beeon one of the most important in the wolrd. However, since 2018, both countries have been involved in a long trade conflict, often called the "trade war", It began when the US accused China of unfair trade practices, such as stealing technology and giving heavy support to chinese compaines. In response, the US government started to impose high tariffs on many chinese goods. China the reacted by adding its own tariffs on American products.

These tariffs made many goods more expenisve for both sides. American companies that import material from China faced higher costs, and Chinese exporters found it harder to sell thieir products to the US market. As a result, global supply chains were also affected, and many seller countries felt the economic pressure.

Although the two countries signed a "Phase one" trade deal in 2020, which required China to buy more American goods, the overall conflict has not fully ended. The US still keeps many tariffs in place, especially on technology related product. In recent year, new issues such as competitioin in semiconductors, electric vehicles, and clean energy  have deepened the tension. The US government continues to restrict Chinese access to advanced technologies, saying it is necessary for national security.

Meanwhile, China has tried to strengthen its own industries and expand trade with other regions, such as southeast asia and europe, to reduce dependence on the american market. However, both counties still rely heavily on each other economically. The US needs Chinese manufacturing and China needs access to the US market and technology.


In the future many experts say that a full resolution is unlikely to happen soon. Instead, both countries may continue to compete while maintaining some cooperation in global issue like climate change. The trade tariff situation show how deeply eonomics and politics are connected in today;s world.
